The rmannot package is part of the AeB Pro family of packages. The package 
creates rich media annotations, in which MOV, MP4, M4V, 3GP, 3G2, and MP3 
files can be played. Rich media annotations is a version 9 feature of 
Acrobat/Adobe Reader. Acrobat Pro and Distiller version 9.0 or later are 
required to build a document, Adobe Reader 9.0 or later is needed to activate 
the annotation and play the media. 

What's New (2020-08-21) This is the update to the rmannot package in response 
to the EOL of Flash player. The package now supports alternate media file 
types. The richness of rich media annotations is gone; there is no longer any 
control of the media using Acrobat JavaScript API. The package is still quite 
functional in this age of "plain" media annotations. The updated package 
features revised documentation, a few new features, and new demo files.
