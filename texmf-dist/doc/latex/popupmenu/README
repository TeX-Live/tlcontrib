The popupmenu Package

popupmenu is a LaTeX package used to create a menu structure. This
menu structure (an array of menu items) is passed to the Acrobat
JavaScript method app.popUpMenuEx() method to create a popup menu.
Using the environments defined in this package, and the command
\popUpMenu, you can create and display hierarchical menus. The menu
items can have JavaScript actions associated with them, they can be
marked and dis-enabled.

The package requires only hyperref. Thus, users of pdftex, dvipdfm,
and dvips can use this package. Two examples are included in the
distribution, additional examples can be found at the AeB Blog
