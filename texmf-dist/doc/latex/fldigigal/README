The fldigigal package
Dated: 12/28/10

The fldigigal package uses the rmannot package (Adobe Distiller workflow
required) to create, what I am calling, an AcroTeX Flash Digital Gallery;
that is, a Flash slide show that displays a series of digitals (PNG, JPG,
GIF). The document author describes the digitals (path and caption) from
the LaTeX source, on compilation, fldigigal write an XML file, which
Distiller embeds in the PDF. The digitals may be embedded in the PDF, or
reside on the Internet (reducing filesize). Three layouts of are offered
at this time: vertical thumbnails, horizontal thumbnails, or no
thumbnails.

The home page for this package is

Now, I simply must get back to my retirement.
