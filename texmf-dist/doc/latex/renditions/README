The renditions package
Dated: 02/05/10

Using the renditions package, you can create many versions, or renditions, of content from the same source file.

This is a short package sets up comment environments, called renditions. These renditions can be included or excluded according to the value of the rendition option. The basic options of this package are max and rendition,

    \usepackage[max=4,rendition=3]{renditions}

In the above example, max=4 declares that there are 4 renditions in the document, the option rendition=3 causes the package to include rendition3, and to exclude all the others rendition1, rendition2, and rendition4.

The renditions package is a stand-alone package, but it was designed for use with the AeB Builder utility.

The package requires the comment package.

Now, I simply must get back to my retirement.
