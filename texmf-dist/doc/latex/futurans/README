 LaTeX Support For Futura Fonts From Adobe As Used By No Starch Press

		       Version 1.3 2008/03/20

This package provides metric files and LaTeX support for Futura fonts
from Adobe.  It has everything you need to typeset in this font -
except the font itself, of course.

There are several versions of the fonts available, different by the
version year.  This package provides support for fonts as used by No
Starch Press, http://www.nostarch.com.  To prevent a clash with
support of a newer version by W. A. Schmidt, the fontname |pfv| is
used instead of the standard |pfu|.

INSTALLATION

First, you need to purchase the fonts themselves: the pfb files are
not included in the package.  If you got the fonts from No Starch
Press, do not rename the pfb files.  However, if there are uppercase
letters in your file names, downcase them.  If you obtained the fonts
from another source, rename the files according to the documentation
(futurans.pdf).

If your TeX system is TDS-compliant, install the files into
$TEXMF/fonts/type1/adobe/futurans. Then download
http://ctan.tug.org/install/fonts/psfonts/adobe/futurans.tds.zip and
unzip this file in $TEXMF.  Add +pfv.map to the configuration files of
dvips, pdftex and your dvi previewer.

Run updmap and texhash programs to update the configuration files and
file names database.

The included style futurans.sty makes your default Sans Serif family.


NOTE

The files were generated using fontinst 1.927.
