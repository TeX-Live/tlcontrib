This package is used to create text, stamp, file attachment, and text box
annotations using Adobe Distiller, these annotations can be viewed in
Adobe Reader. For users of pdf(la)tex, use the pdfcomment package by Josef
Kleber might suffice.

What's New (2018/04/26): Added dummy package named annot-pro to conform with 
CTAN naming. 


Now, I simply must get back to my retirement.
