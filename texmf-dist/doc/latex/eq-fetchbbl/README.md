The eq-fetchbbl package
Author: D. P. Story

Version: v1.0

The eq-fetchbbl package is an application to the exerquiz (eq) and 
fetchbibpes (fetchbbl) packages. This package defines several commands and 
two environments that are used to conveniently build quizzes that challenge 
the user to match Bible passages with their corresponding verse references. 
Technically speaking, such quizzes may be built without this package using 
the techniques illustrated in hhttp://www.acrotex.net/blog/?p=1446 (Exerquiz: 
Match-type questions) and in http://www.acrotex.net/blog/?p=1449 (Exerquiz: 
Randomized matching-type questions). However, when working with Biblical 
topics, it is easier to incorporate the fetching capabilities of 
fetchbibpes.  

Updated packages required are exerquiz (2021/02/21) and fetchbibpes 
(2021/03/08). 

Enjoy the package. Now, I simply must get back to my retirement.
