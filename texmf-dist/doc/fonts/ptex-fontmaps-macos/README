ptex-fontmaps-macos
===================

Current release: 20180306.0

This package is a companion to `ptex-fontmaps' including support for
macOS-specific fonts, which we decided not to be included in TeX Live.

The files contained in this package contain font maps for dvipdfmx to
make various macOS-specific Japanese fonts available for (u)ptex and
related programs and formats.

Please see the README for the package `ptex-fontmaps' for details 
concerning all fonts.

The font maps were written by several people, including (in alphabetic order)
  Hironori Kitagawa
  Norbert Preining
  Saito Shuzaburo
  Takuji Tanaka
  Yusuke Terada
  Hironobu Yamashita
and are now maintained in the github.com git repository:
  https://github.com/texjporg/jfontmaps
