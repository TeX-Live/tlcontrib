Package: opacity-pro

The opacity-pro package defines the \settransparency command and the
settransparency environment. These allow the document to set the blend mode
and opacity of \LaTeX objects. 

PDF Creator: Adobe Distiller is required, with transparancy operator set to true
(/AllowTransparency true).

Also see http://blog.acrotex.net/ for the latest on my
ruminations on LaTeX and PDF.

Now, I simply must get back to my retirement.
