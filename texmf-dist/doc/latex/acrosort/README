This is a package that uses Adobe Distiller as the PDF creator as well as
Acrobat itself.

The AcroSort is a novelty LaTeX package for importing a series of sliced
images of a picture. The sliced images are randomly arranged, then
resorted before the user's eyes using a bubble sort.

Images can be sliced using AcroSlice, also available through CTAN

Now, I simply must get back to my retirement.
