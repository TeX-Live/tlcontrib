Dated: 2016/10/18

What's New: Added support for text box annotations (originally called free 
text annotations). Added new sample file textbox.tex. 

This package is used to create text, stamp, file attachment, and text box
annotations using Adobe Distiller, these annotations can be viewed in
Adobe Reader. For users of pdf(la)tex, use the pdfcomment package by Josef
Kleber might suffice.

Now, I simply must get back to my retirement.
