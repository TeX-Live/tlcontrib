The acroflex package is part of the AeB Pro family of packages.
It is a package that creates a graphing screen using the
rmannot package. The user can type in functions and graph them.
A graphing screen can be populated with pre-packaged functions for
the user the scrutinize and interact with.  The package can graph
functions of a single variable x, a pair of parametric equations that
are functions of t, and a polar function of t.

The graphing screen is a rich media annotation what uses a specially
developed SWF file, called the AcroFLeX Graphing widget. This package
takes advantage of rich media annotations, which is a version 9 feature
of Acrobat. This package requires Acrobat Pro and Distiller version 9.
The user needs to use Adobe Reader 9.0 in order to obtain the graphing
functionality.
