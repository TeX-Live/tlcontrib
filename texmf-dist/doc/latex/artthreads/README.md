The artthreads Package
Author: D. P. Story
Version: v1.3.1
Dated: 2020-07-09

Through the commands of the artthreads package, create PDF article threads, 
a concept/feature of Adobe Reader/Acrobat that has been around since the 
product's beginning. The use of article threads typically only makes sense in 
a document in which the text is in a multi-column format or in narrow columns.

Set the article threads after the composition of the document is completed. 
The method of setting the threads is very visual not automatic as in the 
threadcol package of Scott Patkin (available for pdftex only). 

The artthreads package supports all drivers: dvips, pdflatex, 
lualatex, xelatex, dvipdfm, and dvipdfmx. 

What's New v1.3.1 (2020-07-09) Fixed some issues with lualatex. 
Additonal built-in push buttons and link actions to direct the 
reader to a particular thread. 

Enjoy.
