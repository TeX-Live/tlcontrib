The fc_arith Package
Author: D. P. Story
Dated: 2017-01-16

fc_arith is a LaTeX package used to create an arithmetic flash card.
Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division problems are randomly
generated. There is a menu system for setting the intervals from which to randomly
draw numbers, and the number of decimal places these numbers should have. The user
can optionally compete against the clock, and awarded points as a function of how
fast the problem is correctly solved.

The flash card created by fc_arith can be customized in many ways. Design and build
your own flash card using any of the standard PDF creators.

What's New (2017/01/16) Require eforms dated 2017/01/15 to incorporate \olBdry into code.

What's New (2016/12/10): All the standard PDF creators can build the demo file
fc_noacrobat.tex. If you own the Acrobat application, you can also build
fc_acrobat.tex using any workflow (dvips/distiller, pdflatex, lualatex, and xelatex).
Additional commands are defined to localize virtually strings the package uses. A
redefined menu environment (MenuFC) is more flexible than the old one. Fixed a lot
of bugs found by my greatest user and tester J. Gilg.

Requirements are
    1.  The eforms package (version 2.5c or later, 2010/03/21 or later), and
        is available from the acrotex bundle (http://ctan.org/pkg/acrotex)
    2.  The popupmenu package (http://ctan.org/pkg/popupmenu)
