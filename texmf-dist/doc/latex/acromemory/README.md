AcroMemory requires Adobe Distiller as the PDF creator, as well as the
use of Acrobat.

What's New (2017/02/23) Correct the need for Acrobat as the viewer 
application. The game now correctly function when the user view a AcroMemory 
game in Adobe Reader. 

AcroMemory is a memory game in which you find the matching tiles. There
are two versions, available as options of this package, acromemory1 and
acromemory2 (the default).

acromemory1: Here you have a single game board, a rectangular
region divided by rows and columns. The total number of tiles should be
even, each tile should have a matching twin. The game begins with all
the tiles hidden. The user clicks a tile, then another. If the tiles do
not match, they become hidden again (you did remember the position of
those tiles, didn't you?); otherwise, they remain visible and are now
read-only. The game is complete when the user, with a lot of time on
his/her hands, matches all tiles. There is a running tabulation kept on
the number of tries.  There is also a button which resets the game and
randomizes the tiles.

acromemory2: For this game you have two identical rectangular images
subdivided into tiles (or slices), which are arrayed in rows and columns.
The tiles for one of the two images is randomly re-arranged. The object of
the game is to find all the matching tiles by choosing a tile from one
image and a tile from the other image. As in the first case, if the
selected tiles do not match, they are hidden after a short interval of
time (you did remember the position of those tiles, didn't you?);
otherwise, they remain visible and are now read-only. The game is over
when all tiles are matched; when this occurs, end-of-game special effects
occur that will dazzle the senses. There is an option to view a small
image to help you locate the matching tiles on the non-randomized; useful
if the image is complex. There is no reset button at this time, to play
again, the user must therefore close and open the document.

Now, I simply must get back to my retirement.
