category TLCore
shortdesc Defines category patterns used by tlpsrc-to-tlpdb conversion
longdesc As can be seen, the syntax here is slightly different than a
longdesc normal tlpsrc file: an additional first argument specifies the
longdesc category for this pattern, and a final %NAME% is replaced with
longdesc the package.  Defining new categories merely by adding them
longdesc here is not currently implemented, though it could be done if
longdesc it proves useful.  See the TeXLive::TLPSRC documentation for more.

# auto patterns for category ConTeXt, with special expansion type:
# general form:   %[str:]NAME[:str]%
# - initial str deletes str at the beginning of pkg name (if matches)
# - terminal str deletes str at then end of pkg name (if matches)
# Example:
#    pkg name:   context-foobar
#    %context-:NAME%   expands to     foobar
