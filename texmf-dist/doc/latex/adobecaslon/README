adobecaslon
===========

This package provides support files for the Adobe Caslon font family
in pdfLaTeX. (The LuaTeX and XeTeX engines support system fonts
directly, but there are still good reasons to use pdfTeX.)

Version 2.0:  Added support for expert fonts (Reuben Thomas)

Version 2.1:  Bug fixes, TS1 encoding added for a
	      number of fonts (Reuben Thomas)

Version 2.2:  Documentation update (Reuben Thomas)

Installation
------------

See the file adobecaslon.pdf. If you do not have this file, you
probably have the development sources, not the distribution. Get the
distribution from http://www.ctan.org/pkg/adobecaslon


Building from development sources
---------------------------------

(This should only be necessary if you are a developer wanting to work
on the package.)

Before you start, you must have installed the PostScript Type 1 font
files (.pfb) in TEXMF/fonts/type1/adobe/adobecaslon, and the Adobe
Font Metric files (.afm) in TEXMF/fonts/afm/adobe/adobecaslon.

You also need the ``make'' utility installed (many systems will have
this already).

Then, if you have just the base fonts, run:

    make

or, if you have the expert fonts, run:

    make expert

and then, assuming everything went OK,

    make install

to install in TEXMFLOCAL. If you want to install elsewhere, you can
specify a different TEXMF; for example,

    make install TEXMF=`kpsewhich --expand-var='$TEXMFHOME'`

to install under TEXMFHOME.

Finally, follow the final part of the installation instructions in the
``Installation'' section of adobecaslon.pdf, a copy of which should now
be in the current directory.
