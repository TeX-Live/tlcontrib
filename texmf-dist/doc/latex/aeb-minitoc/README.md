The aeb-minitoc package
Author: D. P. Story
Dated: 2018-09-29

This package creates mini-TOCs through the use of the \insertminitoc command. 
The system is powerful and flexible and allows for some amount of logic.

The package works for a the usual workflows

What's New (2018-09-29): Delayed the redefinition of \addtocontents until beginning of document,
to avoid incompatability with the siunitx package.
