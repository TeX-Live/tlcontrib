The DPS package

Das Puzzle Spiel (dps) is a LaTeX package for creating a puzzle, a message 
actually, and a series of questions and answers. The document consumer 
matches the questions with the answers. With each match, another letter 
appears in the puzzle. Upon completion of all questions, the message hidden 
in the puzzle is revealed. The puzzle is primarily designed for the screen, 
but you can optionally create the game for paper. DPS was created as a 
learning tool.

What's new (2020-06-03) Several options usebtnappr and uselayers. These are 
to support the creation of extended questions; the latter uses layers to 
typeset the questions into the document; the former uses icon appearances to 
do the same. Also, new is you can optionally create a sideshow. A sideshow is 
a tiled graphic that is progressively revealed as the player works through 
the puzzle. There is an additional option of having the tiled graphic appear 
randomly in the designated area and have a bubble sort rearrange the tiles 
into their proper order. There are many other changes and bug fixes. 

The package should work for users of dvips->distiller, pdflatex, lualatex, 
and xelatex. The usebtnappr option is available to all workflows. The 
uselayers option requires the dvips->distiller workflow and the aeb_pro 
package. 

Now, I simply must get back to my retirement.
