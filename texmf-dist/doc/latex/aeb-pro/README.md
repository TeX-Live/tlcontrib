Author: D. P. Story
Dated: 2017-03-08

The AeB Pro Package complements and extends AcroTeX eDucation Bundle.

AeB Pro implements a number of new features:
    (1) AeB Central (this can be used by non-distiller users)
    (2) Complete support for set up the initial view of the document
    (3) Extensive support for document actions: document level JS,
        set document actions (willSave, didSave, etc.) and open
        document actions. (4) Complete support for page actions (5)
        Complete support for full screen mode, and all the current
        transition effects through version 8.
    (6) Methods to easily attach documents
    (7) document assembly methods, methods used immediately following
        PDF creation.
    (8) Methods for linking to attachments and launching attachments
    (9) Support for creating PDF Packages.
   (10) Initializing fields using unicode.
   (11) Basic support for layers, rollovers and animations.
   (12) In this version (v2.1 or later), the package is opened up to 
        non-Distiller workflows. Use the dvips/Distiller workflow to obtain all 
        features, (1)--(11) below, of this package. For authors that have Acrobat 
        but prefer a non-Distiller workflow, use the useacrobat option for 
        features (1)--(10) below. For authors who do not have Acrobat, use the 
        nopro option to access features (1)--(3), 

Extensive examples illustrate all these features.
