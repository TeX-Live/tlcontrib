The mkstmpdad Bundle: The mkstmp_pro and aeb_dad Packages
Author: D. P. Story

This bundle contains two related packages: mkstmp_pro and aeb_dad.
These use Adobe Distiller as the PDF creator, and Adobe Acrobat as well.

1.  mkstmp_pro: Is a simple workflow for creating custom stamps, that
    Acrobat uses for commenting.
2.  aeb_dad: This package uses stamps (created by mkstmp_pro) build a
    Drag and Drop Matching (Game). The end user may drag and drop stamps
    onto target push buttons. If the stamp is dropped onto the wrong
    button, an alert box appears announcing "Wrong!", and the stamp is
    returned to its original place; if the stamp is dropped on the correct
    button, the alert box announces "Right!". This is as close to DAD
    (Drag and Drop) as we can get in PDF.

    Users of Adobe Acrobat can, of course, enjoy DAD Matching, but more 
    importantly, users of Adobe Reader XI (version 11) or later can too! One 
    of the splendid features of ARXI is it enables full support for 
    commenting (and for saving fill-in form fields). Previous versions of AR, 
    users could view stamps and view the associated comments, but could not 
    move the stamps around on the page. With version 11, you can now move 
    stamps (and other comments) around; this feature was the inspiration for 
    DAD Matching (the aeb_dad package). 

Enjoy!

Now, I must get back to my retirement.
