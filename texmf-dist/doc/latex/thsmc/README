	      LaTeX Support For Sans Mono Condensed Font

			Version 1.0d 2008/03/20

This package provides metric files and LaTeX support for The Sans Mono
Condensed Family designed by Lucas de Groot, 1996.  It has everything
you need to typeset in this font - except the font itself, of course.

INSTALLATION

First, you need to purchase the fonts themselves: the pfb files are
not included in the package.  If you got the fonts from No Starch
Press, do not rename the pfb files.  However, if there are uppercase
letters in your file names, downcase them.  If you obtained the fonts
from another source, rename the files according to the documentation
(thmsc.pdf).

If your TeX system is TDS-compliant, install the files into
$TEXMF/fonts/type1/public/thsmc. Then download
http://ctan.tug.org/install/fonts/psfonts/fontfabrik/thsmc.tds.zip and
unzip the file in $TEXMF.  Add +flm.map to the configuration files of
dvips, pdftex and your dvi previewer.
 
Run updmap and texhash programs to update the configuration files and
file names database.

The LaTeX style thmsc.sty makes this font your default typewriter font. 


NOTE

The files were generated using fontinst 1.927.
