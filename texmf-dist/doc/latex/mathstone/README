=========================================

This package provides metric files and LaTeX support for Stone Sans and 
Stone Serif fonts from Adobe. It has everything you need to typeset in this 
font -except the font itself. You need to purchase the fonts 
themselves: the pfb files are not included in the package. 


REQUIREMENTS
=========

1. The Adobe Stone Sans and Stone Serif  fonts must be already installed 
on your system. 
2. To use the Greek letters need to install the package Mathdesign.


INSTALLATION
========

1. Install Adobe Stone Serif and Stone Sans types: you have to rename the afm 
and pfb files following the instructions in the manual Fontname (K. Berry).
2. Install the tfm and vf files (available in the fonts directory).
3. Install mathstone.sty and fd files (available in the tex directory).
4. Add ps8.map and pst.map in the configuration files of dvips, pdftex and 
DVI display (available in the dvips directory). For this refer to the LaTeX distribution.
5. Update database LaTeX files.


HOW TO USE
=======

To use the package, simply add the following line in the preamble of 
your source file:

\usepackage{mathstone}

You can use the following command in your document
Commands:

1. \textsb: command for Stone Sans Semibold font in text mode.
2. \mathversion{normal}: command for Stone Serif font in math environments.
3. \mathversion{bold}: command for Stone Serif Bold font in math environments.
4. \mathversion{semibold}: command for Stone Serif Semibold Italic font in math environments.
5. \mathversion{sans}: command for Stone Sans font in math environments.
6. \mathversion{sanssb}: command for Stone Sans Semibold Italic font in math environments.
