The icon-appr Package
Author: D. P. Story
Dated: 2020-06-05

Use this package to create icon appearances for push buttons, check box buttons,
and radio buttons form fields.

Package works for pdflatex, lualatex, xelatex, dvips/distiller or dvips/ps2pdf; some
techniques require Acrobat. Pdfmark-type drivers require, depending on the method used,
aeb_pro or graphicxsp.

PDF Viewers: Adobe Reader DC, PDF-XChange Editor, and, of course 
Adobe Acrobat. SummatraPDF previews the icon buttons very well. 

What's New 2020-06-05: The basic functionality of this package 
is unchanged. In this version, the AP entry is added to the 
Names dictionary of the PDF catalog. This means that the names 
of the icons imported in the embedding environment are known to 
Acrobat/Adobe Reader/PDF-Exchange Editor. It also allows the 
icons to be manipulated using JavaScript methods, the most 
significant of which is the Doc.getIcon(<icon-name>) method.  
Revised examples illustrate Doc.getIcon().

     
Enjoy!

Now, I must get back to my retirement.
