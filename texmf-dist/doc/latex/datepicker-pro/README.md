The datepicker-pro Package
Author: D. P. Story
Dated: 2018-07-02

One of the (many) deficiencies of Adobe Acrobat Reader/Adobe Acrobat is that 
they have never supported a proper date picker. This package now supplies
one. The \datepicker command creates a readonly text field and a push button 
to its right. Pressing on the pushbutton brings forth a SWF file displaying a 
calendar. The user then chooses a date from the calendar, the the date is 
transferred to the text field.

This is a "pro" application, which, in the jargon of AeB, means that Adobe 
Distiller is required as the PDF creator. The only drivers supported, as a 
result, are dvips and dvipsone. 

As with all such special features, to experience the datepicker, Adobe Reader 
or Acrobat are needed. Most other PDF readers do not support form field, rich 
media annotations, and JavaScript. 

What's New (2018/07/02) Fixed a problem when the month data contain glyphs 
beyond Basic Latin. Specify this using unicode, eg, M\u00E4rz (German for 
March).

Enjoy.
