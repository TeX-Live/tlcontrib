Package: digicap-pro

The digicap-pro package creates captions to digital photos (or graphics) and 
selectively places them on top with a selected opacity. Captions can be 
static or they can be rollovers (hidden until the user rolls over the image). 

As a bonus, the document author can create a photo album complete with 
thumbnail versions of the photos, which when clicked, the fullsize photo 
appears with caption and title. 

PDF Creator: Adobe Distiller is required, with transparancy operator set to true
(/AllowTransparency true).

Also see http://blog.acrotex.net/ for the latest on my
ruminations on LaTeX and PDF.

Now, I simply must get back to my retirement.
