The yt4pdf package
Dated: 2016/10/04

The yt4pdf package uses the rmannot package to embed a special SWF file to
play the YouTube videos. There is a complete set of buttons that come with
the package to control the video: play, pause, stop loading, rewind, load
a video by its YouTube video ID, and a button to view a video on the
YouTube web site. Adobe Acrobat 9 or later is required to author a
document; only Adobe Reader 9 is need to view the created yt4pdf document.

The SWF file for playing the YouTube videos was developed by UVSAR
(http://www.uvsar.com/pdftube/) and is based on the YouTube chromeless
player and the YouTube ActionScript 3.0 Player API Reference
(http://code.google.com/apis/youtube/flash_api_reference.html)

Now, I simply must get back to my retirement.
