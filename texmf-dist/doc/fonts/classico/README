This is the README for the classico package, version
2014-08-28.

This package provides LaTeX, pdfLaTeX, XeLaTeX and LuaLaTeX
support for four URW Classico fonts, which are revisions by
Hermann Zapf for the URW++ foundry of his Optima fonts.

To install this package on a TDS-compliant
TeX system, download the file
"tex-archive"/install/fonts/classico.tds.zip where the
preferred URL for "tex-archive" is http://mirrors.ctan.org.
Unzip the archive at the root of an appropriate texmf tree,
likely a personal or local tree. If necessary, update the
file-name database (e.g., texhash). Update the font-map
files by enabling the Map file classico.map.

To use, add

\usepackage{classico}

to the preamble of your document. This will activate
Classico as the sans-serif text font. The command

\renewcommand\sfdefault{uop}

will also work (for compatibility with legacy documents).

To activate Classico as the main text font, use

\usepackage[sfdefault]{classico}

or 

\renewcommand\familydefault{\sfdefault}

Options scaled=<number> or scale=<number> may be used with
the classico package to scale the fonts.

The only figure style is proportional-lining.

Font encodings supported are OT1, T1, LY1 and TS1. Earlier
versions of this package supported artificial small-caps for
OT1 and T1 encodings; this has been incorporated.

LuaLaTeX and xeLaTeX users who might prefer type1 fonts or
who wish to avoid fontspec may use the type1 option.

Command \classico allows for localized use of Classico.

The URW Classico fonts are

Distribution and modification of these fonts are allowed
subject to the Aladdin Free Public License which is

commercial product.                                         

URW++ has corrected the original fonts and added many
accented glyphs. These corrected and extended fonts are
included in this package with their permission.
