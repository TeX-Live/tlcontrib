This folder, referred to below as zgmsource, contains the ingredients to construct and modify the garamondx font metrics.

1. Copy this entire folder to an area in which you have write permission.
2. To be able to use my bash script, you need to have two other folders alongside zgmSource, as follows:

garamondxf/garamondx
garamondx.tds
zgmSource

You also need to have the environmental variable tmfv set up to point to you home texmf folder, texmf-var. 

3. Copy all the afm and pfb files into zgmSource.
4. Make any changes you wish to the adjust-gm-*.mtx files.
5. Run
./makezgm
to recreate new vpl files.
6. Replace the distributed tfm/vf files with the newly generated tfm/vf files. To avoid confusing the new with the old versions, you should probably change "public" to "urw" in the folders to match the getnonfreefonts layout.
