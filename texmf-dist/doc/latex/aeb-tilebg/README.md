The aeb_tilebg Package
Author: D. P. Story
Dated: 2018/04/26 
Version: v1.2

This package is a simple application of established packages graphicx, 
multido and AeB Web. The package takes a rectangular graphic and uses it to 
tile the background of the pages. 

Download your favorite tiled background swatch from the Internet, convert it 
to an .eps or a .pdf format (depending if you use distiller---should work for 
users of Ghostscript as well---or pdflatex and xelatex), place that image in 
the same folder as your source document. Now, anywhere in your document, use 
the command \setTileBgGraphic to create your tiled background. 

Other features: Turn tiling on or off, Draft mode (an package option)
used during the content development stage. Change the way the tiles
are laid out, change from top-to-bottom to bottom-to-top.

What's new (2018/04/26): Added a dummy package aeb-tilebg, which conforms to 
the listing of this package on CTAN. 

Enjoy!

Now, I must get back to my retirement.
