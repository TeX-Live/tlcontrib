acrosort --- D. P. Story
Dated: 2020-06-17

The AcroSort is a novelty LaTeX package for importing a series 
of tiled images of a picture. The tiled images are randomly 
arranged, then resorted before the user's eyes using a bubble 
sort. 

Images can be tiled using the tile-graphic package, also 
available through CTAN. 

What's New (2020-06-02): Minor suggested changes by CTAN maintainers

What's New (2020-06-02): This is a complete rewrite of the 
package. The package now supports all common PDF creators: 
pdflatex, lualatex, xelatex, dvips->distiller. Multiple bubble 
sort tiles images are now supported. 

Now, I simply must get back to my retirement.
