KETCindy for TeX Live
=====================
The files originally distributed by Prof. Takato have been adapted
by Norbert Preining to work within the framework of TeX Live.
In particular the setketcindy(r).txt and the ScriptInitialization.txt
and its depending template.cdy have been patched to work with
unwritable texmf-dist trees.
