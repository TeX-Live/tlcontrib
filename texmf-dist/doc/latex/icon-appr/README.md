The icon-appr Package
Author: D. P. Story
Dated: 2018-11-23

Use this package to create icon appearances for push buttons, check box buttons,
and radio buttons form fields.

Package works for pdflatex, lualatex, xelatex, dvips/distiller or dvips/ps2pdf; some
techniques require Acrobat. Pdfmark-type drivers require, depending on the method used,
aeb_pro or graphicxsp.

PDF Viewers: Adobe Reader DC, PDF-XChange Editor, and, of course Adobe Acrobat. SummatraPDF
previews the icon buttons very well.
     
Enjoy!

Now, I must get back to my retirement.
