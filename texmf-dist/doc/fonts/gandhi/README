This is the README for gandhi, version 2017-02-26.

This package provides support for use of the GandhiSerif and
GandhiSans families of fonts with LaTeX.

To install this package on a TDS-compliant
TeX system download the file
"tex-archive"/install/fonts/gandhi.tds.zip, where the
preferred URL for "tex-archive" is http://mirror.ctan.org.
Unzip the archive at the root of an appropriate texmf tree,
likely a personal or local tree. If necessary, update
the file-name database (e.g., texhash texmf). Update the
font-map files by enabling the Map file gandhi.map.

For most purposes, simply add

\usepackage{gandhi}

to the preamble of your document. This will activate
GandhiSerif as the main (serifed) text font and GandhiSans
as the sans font. It is recommended that the font encoding
be set to T1 or LY1, but the default OT1 encoding is also
supported. Available shapes in all series include italic and
small caps. Slanted variants are not supported; the designed
italic variants will be automatically substituted.

To activate GandhiSerif without GandhiSans, use the
rm option. Similarly, to activate GandhiSans without
GandhiSerif, use the sf option. To use GandhiSans as the
main text font (as well as the sans font), use the option
sfdefault.

The following options may be used to select number styles:

lf  lining
p   proportional
t   tabular
osf oldstyle

The default is oldstyle proportional. The sans font may
be scaled by using the scale or scaled options. The type1
option may be used if the type1 fonts are preferred or
fontspec is to be avoided.

The original opentype fonts were downloaded from

http://www.tipografiagandhi.com/

and are licensed under a liberal but not entirely free
license. You may not modify the fonts in a font editor or
sell or rent out the fonts. For details look into the doc
directory.

The type 1 fonts were created using cfftot1. The support
files were created using autoinst. The support files are
licensed under the terms of the LaTeX Project Public
License.
