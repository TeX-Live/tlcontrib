The GraphicxSP Package
Author: D. P. Story
Dated: 2016/02/19
Version: v1.0

GraphicxSP is an extension of the graphicx package. GraphicxSP
embeds the graphic in the PDF document once, and allows the document
author to use and re-use that same graphic without significantly
increasing the file size. Additionally, GraphicxSP supports Adobe
transparency imaging model.

GraphicxSP is useful for repeated graphics like backgrounds,
watermarks, company/universit logos and so on.   The graphics
produced by GraphicxSP appears to be clearer at high zoom factors
than the same graphic produced by the classic Graphic package.

Restriction: This package requires that the PDF be created by Adobe
Distiller, version 5.0 or greater for graphics without transparency,
version 5.0 with transparency.

Installation Instructions: Place the zip file in your latex search
path and unzip.  Refresh your file name database, and you are ready
to go. Start with documentation and the demo files contained in the
examples folder.

I maintain a web site featuring TeX/LaTeX/PDF stuff called
AcroTeX (www.math.uakron.edu/~dpstory/acrotex.html).  There you
will find the home web page of the GraphicxSP Bundle.

My other web site is http://blog.acrotex.net/, there you can find all my
ruminations on AeB and PDF.

Now, I simply must get back to my retirement.
