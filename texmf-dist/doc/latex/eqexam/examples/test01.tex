\begin{exam}[Part I.]{Part1}

\begin{instructions}[Part I.]
Solve each of the problems without error. If you make an error,
points will be subtracted from your total score.
\end{instructions}

\begin{problem}[5]
This is an example of a objective question, the student fills in
his/her response in the space below.

\begin{solution}[.5in]
The solution to the question. This solution will not appear when
the option \texttt{nosolutions} is specified. It will appear
immediately after the question with the \texttt{solutionsafter}
option, and appear at the end of the document if a solutions
option is not specified.
\end{solution}
\end{problem}


\begin{problem}[5]
An example of a fill-in question:
It is well known that \fillin{1in}{Newton} and
\fillin{1in}{Leibniz} are jointly credited as the founders of
modern calculus.

\begin{solution}
It is well known that \underbar{Newton} and \underbar{Leibniz} are
jointly credited as the founders of modern calculus.

\medskip\noindent\textbf{Notes.} Here the optional argument for
the \texttt{solution} environment is not specified, this implies
that no room should be left for the student to answer, seems
reasonable since this is a fill-in.
\end{solution}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem*}[2ea]
\textit{True} or \textit{False}.  No justification needed.

\begin{parts}

    \item[h] \TF{T} If triangles have $4$ sides, then all monkeys
    are green. Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid
    of their country.

\begin{solution}
    This is the solution, let's hope it's correct, or I would be
    embarrassed to no end. Now is the time for all good men to
    come to the aid of their country.

    \medskip\noindent\textbf{Notes.} This \texttt{\string\item}
    has an optional argument `\texttt{[h]}', so the
    solution will not appear at the end of the document when there
    is no solutions option, but will appear when
    \texttt{solutionsafter} is specified. The
    \texttt{nohiddensolutions} option can override this feature.
\end{solution}

    \item[H] \TF{T} $1+1=3$ iff $\sqrt2$ is a rational number. Now
    is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their
    country.

\begin{solution}
    \textbf{Notes.} This \texttt{\string\item} has an optional
    argument `\texttt{[H]}', so the solution will not appear at
    the end of the document when there is no solutions option, nor
    does it appear when \texttt{solutionsafter} is specified. The
    \texttt{noHiddensolutions} option can override this feature.
\end{solution}

    \item[h] \TF{F} $(\forall x)(\exists y)(xy>1)$\hskip1em($x$,
    $y$~real numbers). Now is the time for all good men to come to
    the aid of their country.
\begin{solution}
This is a tough solution.
\end{solution}

    \item[h] \TF{F} $(\forall x)(\exists y)(\forall z)(z(x+y)>0)$,
        \hskip1em($x$,~$y$, and~$z$ real numbers).
\begin{solution}
This is a tough solution.
\end{solution}

\end{parts}
\end{problem*}

\begin{problem*}[\auto]
Here is an example of a auto calculate problem. It takes the
optional argument `\texttt{[\string\auto]}'. You specify the
points associated with each part using the \texttt{\string\PTs}
command.

\begin{parts}

\item \PTs{10} This a hard one!

\begin{solution}[.75in]
This is a tough solution.
\end{solution}

\item \PTs{5} This one is ``half'' as hard.

\begin{solution}[\sameVspace]
This solution is easy.
\end{solution}

% The previous solution works well for paper publications, however, when the online
% or email option is taken, a text field is created for the student to type into,
% the graphics and text are superimposed on top this text field, so the student
% types over these elements, not a good solution in this case.
