The bargraph-js Package
Author: D. P. Story
Dated: 2019-04-07

The package uses Acrobat forms and Acrobat JavaScript API to create and 
manipulate interactive bar graphs. This means the user can enter data in a 
couple formats, to populate the bar graphs. The package can also be used to 
create and display discrete probability distributions, for both the pmf and 
cdf of a distribution. 

Any bar graph created by the bargraph-js package requires Adobe Reader DC (or 
Acrobat) for full functionality. 

PDF Creators: Any of the usual PDF creator can be used; however, to repeat, 
an Adobe PDF reader is required for full functionality. 

Enjoy!

Now, I must get back to my retirement.
