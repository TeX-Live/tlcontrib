The qrcstamps package enables the document author to create QR Codes, the 
QR Code Symbology are caste onto a dynamic stamp annotation.


PDF Creator: Adobe Distiller or ps2pdf can be used as the PDF creator, but
the full Acrobat application is needed to perform post-creation tasks. One the
document is created and saved, it can be viewed by any appropriate PDF viewer.

Also see http://blog.acrotex.net/ for the latest on my
ruminations on LaTeX and PDF.

Now, I simply must get back to my retirement.
