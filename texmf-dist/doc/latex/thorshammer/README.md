The thorshammer Package
Author: D. P. Story

WARNING: Adobe Acrobat DC or Adobe Acrobat XI is required for 
post PDF-creation. Any PDF-creator application is supported. 

This package implements an idea by Thorsten G. for assessment 
using PDF quizzes produced by the exerquiz package. Thorsten not 
only wanted to pose multiple choice, multiple selection, and 
fill-in type questions, but also wanted to ask extended response 
questions that would be manually evaluated. Once the quiz is 
graded, the instructor may optionally pass the quizzes through 
an Acrobat action sequence to extract the student's name and 
grade from the quizzes. The extracted information is saved to a 
tab-delimited TXT file. The instructor can later merge this file 
into a larger spreadsheet. 

Note: Unzip action-sequences.zip to obtain the action-sequences folder.

If intriguing, install thorshammer and try this workflow.

What's New (2021-06-24) Moved aeb_pro.js to the acrotex.js package, which is
  now required. Other minor changes and fixes.

What's New (2020-01-21) Published password of action sequences.


Enjoy!

Now, I must get back to my retirement.
