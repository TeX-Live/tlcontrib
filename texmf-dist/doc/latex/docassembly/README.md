Targeted audience: LaTeX authors who love their pdflatex, lualtex, xelatex, 
or dvips -> ps2pdf workflow, who also own Acrobat Pro application. 

The docassembly package defines the docassembly environment in which 
JavaScript code can be written to execute once and only once the newly 
created PDF in the Acrobat application. The package also defines a series of 
helper commands to execute security restricted JavaScript methods. Using 
these security restricted commands, you can place watermarks on the document, 
attached files, import icons and sounds, insert pages, extract pages, send 
email, and so on. All these methods I have used for years through the aeb_pro 
package, which generally restricted to a dvips -> distiller workflow. Now, 
these methods are available to all those who own Acrobat, no matter what PDF 
creator used. 

What's New (2021-06-19) Moved some documentation from this package to 
  the acrotex-js package. New require acrotex-js dated 2021/06/19 or later.

Now, I simply must get back to my retirement.
