Description
===========

The comicsans package makes Microsoft's Comic Sans font available to
LaTeX2e.  comicsans supports all of the following:

  * Roman text, boldface text, small-caps text, and -- with a little
    extra effort -- italic text

  * Cyrillic (roman text, boldface text, italic text)

  * Mathematics using Comic Sans wherever possible


Installation
============

Complete installation instructions appear in the comicsans
documentation, comicsans.pdf (formatted for U.S. Letter paper).  A
brief summary follows:

  * Acquire and install the Comic Sans font.

  * Merge comicsans's texmf directory tree (available from CTAN as
    install/macros/latex/contrib/comicsans.tds.zip) with your local
    TeX directory tree.

  * Point your favorite TeX backend(s) (pdfTeX, Dvips, YAP, Xdvi,
    etc.) to the comicsans font-mapping file.

  * Refresh the TeX filename database.

Acknowledgments

Thanks to Bob Tennent for notifying me that Microsoft ceased
distributing Comic Sans themselves but that the font is now available
on SourceForge; thanks to Rolf Niepraschk for telling me about
cabextract, which can be used to extract fonts from comic32.exe;
thanks to Han The Thanh for presenting an alternate way to package the
Type 1 versions of Comic Sans, which facilitate comicsans's use with
Vietnamese typesetting; and thanks to Norbert Preining for identifying
some issues with the packaging of comicsans for CTAN.
