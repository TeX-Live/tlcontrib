eCards Package
Author: D. P. Story 
Dated: 2016/09/03

The ecards package for LaTeX enables you to create a series of
electronic (flash) cards. The demo file for this package is named
ecardstst.pdf. The document author provides questions, hints and
answers to a series of questions. Users can test their knowledge
by responding to the questions. The questions are delivered in
random order.

What's new (2016/09/03): Improved documentation.

What's new (2016/08/02): The last revision was in 2003, and since then 
there have been many changes in exerquiz. This revision brings ecards into 
harmony with exerquiz (dated 2016/04/18 or later). Additionally, several new 
commands are created to help customize the cards. 

Note: This package requires the AcroTeX eDucation Bundle, exerquiz dated 2016/04/18
or later.

Enjoy!

Now, I simply must get back to my retirement.
