This lucidabr package provides LaTeX support for the Lucida fonts.

The related lucida package, at
http://mirror.ctan.org/fonts/psfonts/bh/lucida, provides basic TeX
support files, such as tfm and map files.

The lucidabr and lucida packages on CTAN are free, but the Lucida fonts
are not: you must order them from TUG or another source to actually
typeset anything in Lucida.  The TUG Lucida web pages explain the
details -- see http://tug.org/lucida.

For installation instructions, after ordering the fonts from TUG, see the
README.TUG file.  (You'll get the same info in email after ordering.)

If you have questions or problems regarding installation or use, please
email lucida@tug.org; this is an open list for Lucida discussion, and
you can subscribe via http://tug.org/mailman/listinfo/lucida.  Questions
or problems related to ordering or licensing should go to
lucida-admin@tug.org.

The lucidabr package is looking for an active maintainer to improve the
documentation, add some requested features, and generally maintain the
distribution.  If you are interested, please email.
