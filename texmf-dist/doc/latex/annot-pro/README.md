This package is used to create text, stamp, file attachment, and text box
annotations using Adobe Distiller, these annotations can be viewed in
Adobe Reader. For users of pdf(la)tex, use the pdfcomment package by Josef
Kleber might suffice.

Check out my http://www.acrotex.net/ website and my blog site as well
at http://blog.acrotex.net/.

What's New (2018/08/13) Now the package supports text markup annotations; these
annotations can break across page boundaries with some help, by setting the crackat
key. All supported annotations can now have rich text content.

What's New (2018/04/26): Added dummy package named annot-pro to conform with 
CTAN naming. 


Now, I simply must get back to my retirement.
